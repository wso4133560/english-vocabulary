Don't be afraid of anyone or anything, as long as you have scruples.
If you are afraid of the wolf in front and the tiger at the back, it will affect your judgment, courage and wisdom.
Fear is the biggest personality disorder in a person's life, it will suppress you, so that you can not really break through yourself.
It is also difficult for you to reach your ideal state of life.

Money determines your temperament.
When you don't have money, you will have a gloomy and worried face.
When you have 500,000, a smile will appear on your face.
When you have 1 million, you will be full of confidence.
When you have 10 million, you will have financial freedom and enjoy life.
When you have 1 billion, everything becomes insignificant.
Therefore within the limits allowed by the law, strive to make money.
Money can solve most of the troubles in life, and it can also assist you in solving the remaining troubles.

The truth of society, the more decisive you are the more people will appreciate you.
The more honest and soft hearted, the more people bully you.
When a person is rational to the extreme, he can bear any price.
A strong man should have 3 basic conditions, a savage body, a civilized mind and an unconquerable spirit.
Remember don't give in to anyone, without yourself it will be meaningless to do anything.
